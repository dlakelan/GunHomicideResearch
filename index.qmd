# Some basic exploratory analysis of firearms ownership and crime across countries


Gun ownership varies widely across countries, as does income inequality, health care, economic opportunity, racism, 
and other aspects of overall quality of life. All of these can influence crime and violence especially 
homicide, robbery, rape, and suicide. This website analyzes several aspects of these issues across cultures, and is a work in progress.

I've just decided to organize this repository using Quarto and will be converting all the documents to qmd files, they'll be available soon.
